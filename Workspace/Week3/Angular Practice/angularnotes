AngularJS
    -strongly opinionated, front end, MVC framework
    
    Strongly oppinionated
        -all in one framework
        -Do almost everything the "Angular" way
        -Doesnt play well with others (JQuery, other frameworks)
        -Dont be dogmatic! Sometimes the best solution is outside of Angular
        
    Front-end
        -While Angular has features to interact with the back-end, it lives all on the front end
        
    MVC- Model View Controller
        -Model, raw data that drives your application
        -View, visual representation of the model
        -Controller, the glue that links the model and view together
        
        AVoiding manipulating the view DIRECTLY
        We will change the MODEL and have ut update the view
        
        Native DOM events/JQuery use atyle of programming called imperative programming
        Angular we use declaritive programming all about setting up systems with rules
        
    Framework
        Just a bunch of code that someone else wrote to help make our lives easier
        
    ===ANGULAR COMPONENTS===
    
    Module
        -containers for your application /code
        -top level, almost all other components go inside of a module
        -just a bucket for your code
        
    Controller
        -What ties your JS and HTML together
        -Are registered to a MODULE
        
    Directives
        -Most often custom HTML attributes
            (ng-show, ng model)
        -Markers that Angular needs to do something for that element
